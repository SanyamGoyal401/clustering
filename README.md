# Clustering Techniques Comparison

## Overview

This project aims to compare three different clustering techniques—KMeans, Hierarchical, and Birch—across various stages of data preprocessing using the PyCaret library. The analysis includes evaluating the clustering performance with different numbers of clusters (3, 4, 5) at different data preprocessing steps such as no preprocessing, normalization, transformation, PCA, and combinations of normalization, transformation, and PCA.


## Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pycaret  # Add other libraries if necessary
pip install ucimlrepo
```

## Clustering Comparison

### Steps

1. No Data Preprocessing
2. After Normalization
3. After Transformation
4. After PCA
5. After Normalization and Transformation
6. After Normalization, Transformation, and PCA

### Number of Clusters

- 3 clusters
- 4 clusters
- 5 clusters

## Results
